# Human Pose Estimation Project

This project focuses on Human Pose Estimation using the MoveNet model with TensorFlow Lite. The goal is to detect keypoint positions on a person's body in images and live video frames. The project provides a Flask web application for both image and live video input, showcasing the real-time capabilities of the model.

## Project Structure

As a Python enthusiast, understanding the structure and technologies involved in this project can provide insights into how AI is integrated into real-world applications.

### 1. TensorFlow Lite and MoveNet:

**TensorFlow Lite (TFLite):**
- TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library, and TensorFlow Lite is a lightweight version designed for mobile and edge devices.
- TFLite enables the deployment of machine learning models on resource-constrained devices.

**MoveNet:**
- MoveNet is a lightweight and efficient model for human pose estimation, developed by Google.
- It predicts keypoint locations on a person's body, providing information about the positions of various body parts (e.g., nose, eyes, shoulders) in an image.

**Integration:**
- The project utilizes the TFLite interpreter to load and run the MoveNet model.
- The `https://github.com/devfemibadmus/human-pose-estimation/releases` module contains functions to process model outputs and visualize keypoint predictions.

### 2. Flask Web Application:

**Flask:**
- Flask is a web framework for building web applications in Python.
- It is lightweight, easy to use, and facilitates the creation of web services.

**Web Routes:**
- The Flask application (`https://github.com/devfemibadmus/human-pose-estimation/releases`) defines routes for handling different functionalities.
- The root route (`/`) handles both image and live video input, processing frames, and rendering the results.
- Other routes, such as `/live` and `/video_feed`, provide live video streaming functionality.

**HTML Templates:**
- The project uses HTML templates (located in the `template/` directory) to structure the web pages rendered by Flask.
- Templates include `https://github.com/devfemibadmus/human-pose-estimation/releases` for image processing and `https://github.com/devfemibadmus/human-pose-estimation/releases` for live video streaming.

**File Upload:**
- The application uses Flask's file upload feature to handle user-uploaded images.
- Uploaded images are saved in the `medias/` directory.

### 3. Image Processing:

**Image Preprocessing:**
- The `process_image` function in `https://github.com/devfemibadmus/human-pose-estimation/releases` loads, resizes, and preprocesses the input image for model inference.

**Model Inference:**
- The pre-trained MoveNet model is used to perform keypoint detection on the input image.

**Visualization:**
- The `draw_prediction_on_image` function in `https://github.com/devfemibadmus/human-pose-estimation/releases` visualizes the keypoint predictions on the original image.

**Result Display:**
- The results (original and predicted images) are displayed on the web interface.

### 4. Live Video Processing:

**Video Feed:**
- The `/video_feed` route streams live video frames captured from the camera.

**Frame Processing:**
- The `process_frames` function captures frames, preprocesses them, runs model inference, and streams the processed frames in real-time.

### 5. Project Structure:

**Model File:**
- The pre-trained MoveNet model is stored in the `https://github.com/devfemibadmus/human-pose-estimation/releases` file.

**Static Files:**
- Uploaded and processed images are stored in the `medias/` directory.
- Static files (CSS, JS) and HTML templates are organized within the project structure.

### 6. Requirements:

Dependencies are listed in the `https://github.com/devfemibadmus/human-pose-estimation/releases` file, and they can be installed using pip.
`Python >=3.0, <=3.11.5`

# Note: Rendering Performance and the Limitations of Web-based Human Pose Models

Dear User,

We understand that you may have noticed some delays in rendering the human pose model on our web application built using Python and TensorFlow with Flask. We would like to provide you with an explanation for the slower rendering and highlight the differences between web and mobile applications in terms of performance.

## Complex Computations

Human pose estimation involves intricate mathematical calculations and deep learning algorithms. These computations require substantial processing power, especially when dealing with large models or high-resolution images. The limitations of web browsers and server infrastructure may cause slower rendering compared to more powerful dedicated hardware.

## Resource Limitations

Web applications often operate within resource-constrained environments, such as limited CPU and memory capacities, when compared to native mobile applications. These constraints can impact the performance and responsiveness of the model, resulting in slower rendering times.

## Network Latency

Web applications heavily rely on network communication between the client (browser) and the server. The time taken to send image data to the server for processing and receiving the results back can contribute to rendering delays, particularly if the network connection is slow or unstable.

## Optimization Challenges

While it is possible to optimize and fine-tune a web-based human pose model, achieving the same level of performance as native mobile applications can be challenging due to the differences in underlying technologies and hardware acceleration capabilities.

As an example, consider Snapchat. Snapchat utilizes sophisticated augmented reality (AR) filters and real-time face tracking, which require significant computational resources. To achieve optimal performance and a smooth user experience, Snapchat utilizes native mobile applications that can harness the full power of the device's GPU and CPU, providing real-time rendering capabilities.

When comparing the speed of a human pose model on a mobile application versus a web application, the former tends to be faster due to the following factors:

- **Hardware Acceleration:** Native mobile applications can leverage specialized hardware features like the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) to accelerate complex computations, leading to faster rendering times.
- **Reduced Network Overhead:** Mobile applications often process data locally, eliminating the need for frequent network communication. This reduces network latency and results in faster real-time rendering.
- **Platform Optimization:** Mobile operating systems provide frameworks and tools optimized for real-time processing, ensuring efficient execution of complex tasks like human pose estimation.

While web-based human pose models can provide valuable functionality and convenience, they may exhibit slower rendering speeds compared to their native mobile counterparts due to the aforementioned factors.

We appreciate your understanding and patience regarding the rendering performance of our human pose model in the web environment. Our team is continuously working on optimizations to enhance the model's efficiency and deliver faster rendering times. Please feel free to reach out to us with any further questions or feedback.
